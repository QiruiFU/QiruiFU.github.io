A linear Equation System can be written as a matrix form: $$ Ax = b $$ where $A$ is a $N\\times N$ matrix and $x,b$ are $N\\times 1$ vectors. Actually, we have a lot of methods to solve this problem, like Gauss-Seidel iteration, Gaussian elimination, etc. When simulating fluid, we always use Conjugate Gradient to solve linear system because it’s more quick than other methods.

Then use negative gradient as the dirction we will step and step to the lowest point, which is $x_1$. Iterate this loop again and again, we will get lower and lower in the valley and finally we will get the lowest position. This method is “steepest descent method”. In steepest descent method, every time we use $$ -\\nabla f = b - Ax_i $$ as the direction to step. It’s an intuitive choice, but we can find some better direction in global aspect.

Now, we define “A-orthogonal”. We say $a$ and $b$ are A-orghogonal if $$ (a,b)^A = a^TAb = 0 $$ With A-orthogonal vectors ${a_1, …, a_n}$ , we can easily find the represent of solution $x$ in such a base: $$ x = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{(a_k, b)}{(a_k, a_k)^A} a_k $$ So the problem is: how to find the A-orthogonal vectors? If you’re good at linear algebra, you might say finding the eigen vectors of A. But it’s not a good idea because calculating eigen vectors is even more difficult than solving the equations. So, we choose to generate them dynamically : First, we can give an arbitrary vector as $a_1$. To generate $a_2$, we choose an arbitrary vector $t_2$ which is not parallel with $a_1$ . Then we can get $a_1$ by: $$ a_1 = t_2 - \\frac{(t_2, a_1)^A}{(a_1, a_1)^A} a_1 $$ For $a_k$, we have an arbitrary vector $t_k$ which is not parallel with $a_i (1\\leq i \u003c k)$ . Then we have : $$ a_k = t_k - \\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \\frac{(t_k, a_i)^A}{(a_i, a_i)^A} a_i $$ In fact, method above is a Gram–Schmidt process in A-orthogonal. But it’s not efficient enough in solving the linear equation, we can even make it better.

But if we combine it with deepest descent method, we can have a better verison. If we use $-\\nabla f = b - Ax_{k-1}$ as $t_k$ , we can prove (by induction) that: $$ a_k = t_k - \\frac{(t_k, a_{k-1})^A}{(a_{k-1}, a_{k-1})^A} a_{k-1} $$ is A-orthogonal with $a_i (1\\leq i \u003c k)$ , where $x_{k-1}$ is: $$ x = \\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \\frac{(a_i, b)}{(a_i, a_i)^A} a_i $$ which means we don’t need to run the loop to find the $a_k$ . Now, we have the algrithm for CG : have a initial guess x t = b - A * x a = t x = a.dot(b) / a.Adot(a) * a for i in range(n) : t = b - A * x a = t - t.Adot(a) / a.Adot(a) * a x += a.dot(b) / a.dot(a) * a looks good, right? So why did I mention the deepest descent method? The truth is, if you read this code carefully, you will find that it’s almost same as the code for deepest descent method. The only difference is in deepest descent method we use $t_i = b - A * x_i$ as step direction but in CG we use $a_i$ , which is computed from $t_i$ .

If we choose $t_k$ smartly, we can avoid the loop. In steepest descent method, using $-\\nabla f$ as direction is not good enough. We can choose a direction that is A-orthogonal with all directions we’ve steped before. In this method we will have at most $n$ steps to destination. Actually, in practice we don’t need to run all $n$ loops. At most time if $b - Ax$ is small enough we can break the loop. If $A$ is ill-conditioned, we will have more steps to make it small enough, so we have some pre-conditioner to make matrix $A$ more “health”.

Recall what we did in simulating Spring-Mass system: Firstly, we describe deformation of springs using $\\mathbf{F} = \\frac{\\mathbf{x}_1 - \\mathbf{x}_2}{l_0}$. Something noticable here is that $\\mathbf{F}$ is a vector and it is related to rotation of springs. Then, we define strain $G = |\\mathbf{F}| - 1$. The purpose of $G$ is that it is a scale and only related to stretch and contraction of springs. So it is exactly what matters in calculating energy. After describing deformation, we use $ \\Psi = \\mu G^2 = \\mu (\\frac{\\mathbf{x}_1 - \\mathbf{x}_2}{l_0}-1)^2 $ to show the potential energy of $dm$ , where the $\\mu$ is Young’s modulus. Actually, the relationship between deformation and energy is found out by physicians (specifically, Hooke), at most time we only use it. So, the total energy of whole spring is $E = \\Psi l_0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{2\\mu}{l_0}(|\\mathbf{x}_1-\\mathbf{x}_2|-l_0)^2$, where the $\\frac{2\\mu}{l_0}$ is $k$, which we’re familiar with in physics class. At last, we use $F = -\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}$ to calculate the force of two points of spring. Having force, we can advance the points and finish simulating. An important thing is, density of energy $\\Psi$ is assumed to be equally distributed in the spring, so we can calculate energy using $E = \\Psi l_0$.

Actually, like spring-mass system, in FEM we devide the whole project into different “mesh”. In 2D simulation we always use triangular and in 3D simulation we always use tetrahedron. glasses divided by meshs In FEM, a mesh is like a spring, we can calculate deformation of it and thus calculate energy of it. You can consider a mesh as a high-dimension spring. To be specific, we take an example of triangle mesh. At first, the mesh has no energy, we call it stay in “Reference”. During the simulation, the mesh has displacement, it becomes: We can define the relationship between $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{X}$ : $\\mathbf{x} = \\Phi(\\mathbf{X})$. In linear FEM, we assume $\\Phi$ is a linear function, so $\\mathbf{x = FX + b}$. Then we can calculate $\\mathbf{F = [x_1-x_0, x_2-x_0][X_1-X_0, X_2-X_0]^{-1}}$, where $\\mathbf{F}$ is a $2\\times 2$ matrix. Then, we need a strain $\\mathbf{G}$ to eliminate rotation and advecton in $\\mathbf{F}$. In my code, I use $\\mathbf{G = \\frac{1}{2}(F^TF-I)}$, which is called Green Strain. Next, we should calculate density of energy $\\Psi$ in the mesh. In my code I use StVK model, which says $\\Psi = \\mu ||\\mathbf{G}||_F^2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{2}tr(\\mathbf{G})^2$. In this model, $\\mu = \\frac{k}{2(1+\\nu)}, \\lambda=\\frac{k\\nu}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)}$, where $k$ is Young’s modulus and $\\nu$ is Poisson’s ratio. With the same assumption in spring-mass system, we can calculate $E = V\\Psi$. Then we can use $-\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}$ to calculate force at vertices of triangular. But here is a problem: what is $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}$ ? To be honest, it is really difficult to deduce the final result. In the future I will put it in the Appendix, but now I can tell you the result directly: $$ \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} = VP[\\mathbf{X}_2-\\mathbf{X}_0, \\mathbf{X}_1-\\mathbf{X}_0]^{-T} $$ where $P = FG$, which is called Piola-Kirchhoff stress. After caculating force, the main body of simulating is finished.
