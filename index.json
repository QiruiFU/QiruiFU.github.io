In the past, I wrote some blogs in 洛谷. But the blog function has been cancled in 洛谷 now, so I am unable to design the webpage and you can only read the articles in column format(By the way, they’re all written in Chinese). In purpose of recording my feelings and displaying my CV and information like a researcher, I dicide to build this website with help of Hugo. In the future, I am going to upload some articles to this site and share the link in different occations. Hope I will succeed. 祝我成功。 ","date":"2024-06-18","objectID":"/first-blog/:0:0","tags":["life"],"title":"First Blog Here","uri":"/first-blog/"},{"categories":null,"content":"About Me I am a student in Nanjing University.
