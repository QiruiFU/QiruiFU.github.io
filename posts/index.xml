    <description><![CDATA[Conjugate Gradient Method in Solving Linear Equation System Linear Equation System In fluid simulation, sometimes we need to solve a Linear Equation System like doing projection in Eulerian fluid. A linear Equation System can be written as a matrix form: $$ Ax = b $$
where $A$ is a $N\times N$ matrix and $x,b$ are $N\times 1$ vectors. Actually, we have a lot of methods to solve this problem, like Gauss-Seidel iteration, Gaussian elimination, etc.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Finite Elements Method for Simulating Elastic Body What do we do in simulating spring-mass system? Recall what we did in simulating Spring-Mass system:
  Firstly, we describe deformation of springs using $\mathbf{F} = \frac{\mathbf{x}_1 - \mathbf{x}_2}{l_0}$. Something noticable here is that $\mathbf{F}$ is a vector and it is related to rotation of springs.
  Then, we define strain $G = |\mathbf{F}| - 1$. The purpose of $G$ is that it is a scale and only related to stretch and contraction of springs.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[A Start of this Website As a student major in Computer Science, I think it&rsquo;s really cool to build my own website. In the past, I wrote some blogs in 洛谷. But the blog function has been cancled in 洛谷 now, so I am unable to design the webpage and you can only read the articles in column format(By the way, they&rsquo;re all written in Chinese). In purpose of recording my feelings and displaying my CV and information like a researcher, I dicide to build this website with help of Hugo.]]></description>
