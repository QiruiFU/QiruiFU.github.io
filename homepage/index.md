## About Me

I am currently a master's student in the [Computer Graphics & Game Technology(CGGT)](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/graduate/program-offerings/mse-in-computer-graphics-and-game-technology/) 
 program at the University of Pennsylvania. Previously, I received a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Technology from Nanjing University.

I am interested in physical simulation and computational physics. I am looking for an opportunity to pursue a Ph.D. starting in the summer of 2026.

## Miscellaneous
I love playing soccer and I am a big fan of Real Madrid. I also like watching movies and football games in NFL.
